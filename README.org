* Introduction
* Project Guidelines
* About this Repo
  
** In order to run this project at this stage:
   
   In the client/ folder, make sure to make a directory called data/DATA01/

   1.) Open two terminals
   2.) cd into client and cd into server for each terminal respectively
   For each terminal:
   3.) Do a npm init -y
   4.) npm install
   5.) npm start

User Operation List
| Operation                               | I/O                  | GUI Action                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Create Empty Event                      | {}->event            | Draw a r ectangle to indicate approximate start and end dates in the timeline or right click on the hierarchy viewer to create a new event, and then enter details.            |
| Create Event(manual)                    | {MMO}->event         | Draw a r ectangle to indicate approximate start and end dates in the timeline or right click on the hierarchy viewer to create a new event, and then enter details.            |
| Create Events using a cluster algorithm | {MMO} -> {event}     | Select multiple media items from the gallery, and then right click to se lect the clustering options. Multiple events will be created automatically based on the events dates. |
| Insert Media                            | {MMO}, event         | Select one or more media items inserted into existing event then DnD into the desired event on the hierarchy viewer or timeline.                                               |
| Remove Event                            | {MMO}                | Select one or multiple media items, and then right click to remove to an archive.                                                                                              |
| Attach Event                            | {event},event        | Select an event to be atta ched then DnD to the desired event. If the event is not within the time range of the super-event, it would not be attached                          |
| Detach from super-event                 | {event}, super-event | Select an event to detach then DnD it outside the super-event                                                                                                                  |


* Demonstrating Design Efficacy and Event-Clustering through Experimentation
  

**** Compared with Competitors
     Apple Photos, Google Albums

****  Experimentation
***** Effectiveness of Time-Based Clustering to Define Events
***** Usefulness of the proposed interactions for users in managing information

***** Qualitative and Quantitative results 
     + Likert Scales, Questionnaires, and Surveys
     + Empirical measurements of access complexity via motions/time
     + Estimate the NASA Task Load Index score for various environments

Events
-> Theory, event-relations, clustering

GamePlan
There are 3 things that need to be completed by tomorrow.
1 The application
2 The writeup
3 The test server

The application and writeup are priority one
Then the test server.
Using a test server allows us to make changes after midnight.

* Application
** Creating a proper events pipeline
** Create Events Form
** Creating proper event logic(i.e. calculating starting time and ending time)
** Connecting GPS widget
** Creating a Timeline
    All of dates from ie 2000 to 2022
    


    
** Creating an event hierarchy



Writeup


so there are 4 termianls opened
1 is for running 'npm start' in server, the other for client/

the other two are scratch terminals incase you need it







* Saturday
GUI 
- Timeline
- Spatial Map
- Event Viewer
- Event Hierarchy Manager

Theory
- Creating an event based on time
- Creating an event based on space 

Experiments
- 

 üê± Itinerary üê±
 - K-Means Clustering and output Cluster #'s
 - Connect it to html
 - Connect Polygon Regions



So right now we have a list of randomPoints 
and a list of relativePoints, which is the distance from the 1st point to each of the randomPoints
K is 4, so we have 4 randompoints

Now for the 4th step...
We assign the 1st point to the nearest cluster

So we take the difference from each random point






Okay, let's create an event input page
It should contain all of the images in a scrollable box on the left
and you should click to check it
On the right is the event itself.
POSTing will create a new event.

all of the buttons in the left are encapsulated in a from
the entire page should be consist of multiple forms

each button should represent a post request that updates a list with 
the File object itself.

on click, the button should do some kind of animation to verify it is an active button
